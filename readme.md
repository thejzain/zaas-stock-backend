# Stock Prediction and Trading Assistant

This project is an application that predicts stock prices using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model and provides assistance to users for buying and selling stocks. It is built using Express, a web application framework for Node.js, and React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Installation

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-prediction-assistant.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd stock-prediction-assistant
   ```
3. Install the dependencies for both the backend (Express) and frontend (React):

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install

   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```
4. Set up the configuration file:

   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and specify the required environment variables. For example:

   ```env
   ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

   Make sure to replace `your-api-key` with your actual Alpha Vantage API key, which is used for fetching stock data.

## Usage

1. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the Express server on `http://localhost:5000`.
2. Start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the React development server on `http://localhost:3000` and open the application in your default browser.
3. Use the application:

   - The homepage provides a search bar where you can enter the stock symbol (e.g., AAPL for Apple Inc.). Click on the "Search" button to get stock predictions for the entered symbol.
   - The application will use the ARIMA model to predict future stock prices based on historical data.
   - The predictions are displayed as charts, showing the historical and predicted stock prices.
   - The application also provides a "Buy" or "Sell" recommendation based on the predicted price trends. However, please note that these recommendations are not financial advice, and you should exercise your own judgment when making investment decisions.

## Development

If you wish to contribute to this project, here are the steps to set up the development environment:

1. Follow the installation steps mentioned above.
2. Make sure you have the required tools for frontend development, such as Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).
3. Create a new branch for your changes:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature
   ```
4. Make your changes and test them locally.
5. Commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.
6. Create a pull request to the main repository's `develop` branch, describing the changes you have made.
7. Wait for the project maintainers to review and merge your changes.
